# Meld (Vulkan intermediary lib)

This is set to grow into a set of utilities to make vulkan development less boiler-plate oriented for common tasks. One of the great benefits of vulkan is its explicit nature, however this raises the barrier to entry for the api. This library is aimed at providing building blocks to simplify common tasks with vulkan while maintaining flexibility where desired.

This is very much a stub project, it is my initial work with vulkan from quite a while ago that I do not want to loose to harddrive failure. As i find use for utilities in my own projects I will share them here and organize this project together (current state is very much that of a hack.
